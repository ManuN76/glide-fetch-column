# Generated Faces Column

This is an [Experimental Code Column](https://docs.glideapps.com/all/reference/data-editor/computed-columns/experimental-code-column) for Glide.

- It's written in TypeScript.
- It's deployed on GitHub Pages.
- It's unit-testable.

## Deployment

Commits to `master` compile and deploy the column on the `gh-pages` branch, so be sure to enabled GitHub Pages for that branch in your repo settings to host your column on GitHub.

The column URL for the origin repo is https://dvdsgl.github.io/glide-generated-faces/
